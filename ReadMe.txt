Initially Run python script to scrape data off of mhtml page which uploads to json file

Look at file you want to run initially to find pattern that indicates due dates (For test file start word is 'Due at' and end keyword is '"')

File name needs to be manually added to HTML variable

Host local server on html script afterwards and only future dates will be added (Test case only goes up to April 1st, 2024 but dates can be added to json file if you want to test it)

Html file requires Live Server extension with local server port 5500 to work with google API
